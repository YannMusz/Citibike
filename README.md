# Citibike
NYC Citibike with Tableau

## Purpose: 
1. Import data into Tableau.
2. Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
3. Use Tableau worksheets to display data 
4. Portray data accurately using Tableau.

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
Review of Citi Bike data from NYC for use in Des Moines. Use of geographical data user type and genders to see if this would be a profitable investment in Des Moines. Some more data points used were peak usage times, usage duration and target market.


## Cleaning the Data:
Jupyter Notebook was used to change the trip duration data to a datetime field.
